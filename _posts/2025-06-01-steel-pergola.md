## Requirements

Build a projecting roof (pergola) to provide shelter from Sun light and Rain. 

## Detailed Requirements

Match the dimensions of the farm house pergola

Use steel and clay roof tiles remaining from the farm house renovation.

Be able to maneuver and park a small hatchback car under the Pergola

## Available stock of steel

|Material | Stock Qty |
|---------|-----------|
|0.75 inch by 1.5 inch, 2mm thickness steel rectangular pipes|20 lengths*|
|1.5 inch by 2.5 inch, 3mm thickness steel rectangular pipes|3 lengths|
|1.5 inch by 2.5 inch, 3mm thickness steel rectangular pipes|2 nos. of 8ft pieces|
|3 inch diameter, 4mm thickness pipe| 3 lengths|
|4 inch by 4 inch, 2mm thickness rectangular pipe|2 nos. of 6 ft pieces|
|4 inch by 4 inch, 3mm thickness rectangular pipe|1 no. of 8 ft piece|
|6 inch by 6 inch metal plates of 6 mm thickness| 5|
|1.06m by 2.6m PUF sheets of 50mm thickness |5 full pieces and one half piece|
|8 inch by 12 inch Clay roof tiles | approx. 400 nos.|

* 1 length = 19ft 9 inch is the standard length of steel pipes and angles sold in India.

## Initial concept

Provide two pillars in the front.

On the rear use the protruding 4 inch by 4 inch pipes of 3 nos.

Use the 1.5 inch by 2.5 inch pipe for the rear to front beam by inserting them into the 4 inch by 4 inch pipe. The smaller pipe is inserted into teh larger pipe at an angle which provides the required height in the front and also makes sure that it tousches both the lower and upper sides of the 4 inch by 4 inch pipe.

Since only two pillars are present in the front, make trellis truss structure for the front beam.

Hang a truss made from 0.75 inch by 1.5 inch pipes between the left and the center 4 inch protruding pipes to support one additional 1.5 inch by 2.5 inch rear to front beam.

The support for the roof tiles is provided by 0.75 inch by 1.5 inch pipes with their 1.5 side perpendicular to the ground. 

## Detailed Design 

Use Claude sonnet 3.7 to validate the design and get detailed specifications for the front trellis truss structure. Spaced the top and bottom chord 9 inch apart and provided 15 vertical supports and 10 diagonal supports.

A selfie of myself! Used generic welding glasses and mask as smoke during welding and cutting is not good. Aditionally used Studds helmet with front visor for protecting the face from welding and cutting sparks. Used HILLSON Mens Welsafe Safety Gumboots.

Stock electrode holder and earthing clamp of iBell M220-76 are not good. Hence have replaced it with KEEAN ARC Welding Euro Style Electrode Holder + Heavy Duty Earthing Clamp, Combo, 400 AMP, Without cable wire

Inserting and Welding of the rear to front 1.5 inch by 2.5 inch beams to the 4 inch square pipes:

Welding of the second rear to front beam on the hanging support. Provided a spacer at the bottom to ensure this beam is at the same vertical height as the other three:

Placed the horizontal pipes for supporting clay roof tiles with it's 1.5 inch side perpendicular to the rear to front beams as strength achieved is multiple times higher than having the 0.75 inch side perpendicular to the beam.

Partially completed structure. I have left the rear still empty as I am not sure if I have adequate number of clay roof tiles. I plan to cut and put PUF sheets at the rear if we fall short of clay tiles.

Painted the structure with Nippon Smoke grey enamel.

Added triangulation to the front truss to make it truly trellis structure. Also added additional pillar at the center as required to handle the one ton load of the clay tiles:
