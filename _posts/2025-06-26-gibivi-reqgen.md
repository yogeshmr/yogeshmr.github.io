The tool also provides a convenient way to organize requirement specifications under a Product that you are working on. A Product is a collection of artifacts such as requirements, flowcharts, quotations etc.

Before providing a spoken language prompt, the tool requires the document info to be setup. The Document info can be used to capture Company details, Metadata and define Author and Reviewers for various categories of requirements.
