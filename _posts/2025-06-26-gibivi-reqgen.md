# Document Info

Before providing a spoken language prompt, the tool requires the document info to be setup. The Document info can be used to capture Company details, Metadata and define Author and Reviewers for various categories of requirements.

The document info need to be setup only for the first time and it will get carried forward to the next prompts and allows editing as well.

# Providing spoken language prompt

Enter the spoken language prompt in the text area and click on Generate Requirements.

The tool calls LLM API, parses the response and fills the requirements under different categories.
