# Products

To be able to publish products in the marketplace, first they have to be created. A product can be created in the Products page of from the flowchart and requirements tool as well.

While creating a Product, details such as Name, Team, Milestones and Budget can be recorded. These details will not be pushed to marketplace when the Product is published and hence it is internal to the creator.

Created products can be viewed in the Products page.
